# :bear: Going

I want to learn some [go](https://golang.org/).

## Goals

- [ ] I want to containerise all of this work from the start, and develop inside that container in vscode.
- [ ] I want to write a basic REST API with the [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package. It sounds like a seriously smart and powerful framework, and the underlying code seems pretty friendly!
- [ ] I want to write a basic CLI with [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). Lots of great CLIs which I use regularly (including the docker and stripe CLIs!) are written with cobra.
